## Description

This is a project I created to mimic the appearance of the YouTube homepage using HTML and CSS. The goal was to showcase my proficiency in front-end web development and design. The project is hosted and can be accessed using the following link:

[Live Demo](https://arthurdao1022.github.io/Youtube-Homepage-Project/)

Alternatively, you can run the project locally by following the steps below:

### Local Setup

Follow these steps to run it locally:

a. Download the project from the GitHub repository: https://github.com/ArthurDao1022/Youtube-Homepage-Project

b. Install the Live Server extension by Ritwick Dey for your preferred code editor.

c. Right-click on the index.html file and select "Open with Live Server." This will launch the Youtube Homepage in your default web browser.

## Functionality

The buttons included in this project are primarily for aesthetic purposes and do not have any functional implementation, except for the interactive elements described below:

- Video Thumbnails: Clicking on a video thumbnail would typically lead to the respective video's page, but this functionality is not implemented in this project.
- Profile Picture: Clicking on the profile picture might lead to the user's channel or profile, but again, this functionality is not present in this project.
- Back Button: The back button is interactive and can be used to navigate within the project.

Feel free to explore and interact with the interactive elements to get a feel of the YouTube homepage experience.

Thank you for checking out my project! If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out.
